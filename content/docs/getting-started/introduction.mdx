---

# Introduction

**Pixel Perfect** is a collection of hyper-animated React components built with Motion (Framer Motion) and GSAP. These components are designed for developers who want bold, kinetic UI elements with personality and visual impact.

---

## Philosophy

- **Motion-first design** - Animations define the component's identity
- **Cinematic interactions** - Inspired by experimental UI and award-winning websites
- **Fully expressive** - From glitchy buttons to elastic elements and scroll-reactive components
- **Completely customizable** - Modify timelines, easing, Motion props, or GSAP sequences

---

## Tech Stack

- **React** (v18+)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** (recommended)
- **Motion (Framer Motion)** - Spring-based animations and interaction-driven effects
- **GSAP** - Timeline-based animations and physics-like sequences

---

## Prerequisites

- React app (Vite, Next.js, CRA, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Node 16+
- Package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm)

---

## Installation

### CLI (Recommended)

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn add @pixelperfect/<component-name>
pnpm install
```

This copies component files into your `/components` directory for easy customization.

### Manual

Copy component source from docs or the repo's `src/components` folder, install dependencies, and import.

```bash
npm install motion
```

---

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/Button'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="p-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome</h1>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('clicked!')}>Click me</Button>
    </main>
  )
}
```

---

## Customization

- **Tailwind-first** - Override utility classes or use `className` props
- **Theme tokens** - Customize colors, radii, and spacing via `theme.ts` or CSS variables
- **Composition** - Most components accept `className`, `style`, and `as`/`component` props

---

## Accessibility

Components include:

- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader-friendly labels

Report accessibility issues on GitHub.

---

## Component Conventions

- TypeScript React components (`.tsx`)
- Standard props: `className`, `style`, `variant`, `size`
- Each component folder includes: `index.tsx`, `types.ts`, and documentation

---

## Troubleshooting

**Styles not showing?**  
Ensure Tailwind is configured and imported (usually `app/globals.css`).

**Animations jittery?**  
Use `transform` and `translate` instead of `left/top` for better performance.

**Type errors?**  
Check that your TS config has `jsx: react-jsx` and `@types/react` installed.
