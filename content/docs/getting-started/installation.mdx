# Installation

Get started with the UI library by installing it in your project.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A React 18+ project
- Tailwind CSS configured (if using styled components)

## Install via npm

```bash
npm install @pixelperfect/ui
```

## Install via yarn

```bash
yarn add @pixelperfect/ui
```

## Install via pnpm

```bash
pnpm add @pixelperfect/ui
```

## Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure your project to use the components.

### Tailwind CSS Setup

If you're using Tailwind CSS, make sure your `tailwind.config.js` includes the library's content paths:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './node_modules/@your-library/ui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    // ... your other content paths
  ],
}
```

### Import Components

You can import components individually:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@your-library/ui/components/Button';
import { Card } from '@your-library/ui/components/Card';
```

Or import from the main entry point:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Input } from '@your-library/ui';
```
